# Security Checklist

> Quick reference for security review. See `.claude/rules/security.md` for full rules.

## Pre-Commit Checks

- [ ] No secrets in code (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files (`.env`, credentials)
- [ ] `.env.example` contains only placeholder values
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs with credentials

## Authentication

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (rounds >= 12) or argon2
- [ ] Session cookies: `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: 'lax'`
- [ ] JWT tokens have reasonable expiry (15min access, 7d refresh)
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints (max 10 attempts/15min)
- [ ] Logout invalidates session/token

## Authorization

- [ ] Every endpoint checks authentication
- [ ] Resource ownership verified (no IDOR)
- [ ] API keys are scoped appropriately
- [ ] JWT signature, expiration, and issuer validated
- [ ] Admin functions protected

## Input Validation

- [ ] All user input validated at system boundary
- [ ] Allowlist validation preferred over blocklist
- [ ] String lengths constrained
- [ ] Numeric ranges validated
- [ ] File uploads restricted by type and size
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (never string concat)

## Security Headers

```javascript
// Required headers
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=()
```

## CORS

- [ ] Restrictive origin allowlist (no `*` in production)
- [ ] Credentials mode appropriate
- [ ] Methods and headers restricted

## Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses
- [ ] No secrets in logs
- [ ] PII encrypted when required
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Database backups encrypted

## Dependencies

```bash
# JavaScript — run regularly
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Python — run regularly
pip-audit
pip-audit --fix
```

- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Lock file committed (`package-lock.json` / `requirements.txt`)

## Error Handling

- [ ] Generic error messages in production
- [ ] No stack traces exposed
- [ ] No database details in errors
- [ ] No internal paths revealed

| #   | Vulnerability             | Check                                    |
| --- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Broken Access Control     | Auth on all endpoints?                   |
| 2   | Cryptographic Failures    | Secrets encrypted? HTTPS?                |
| 3   | Injection                 | Inputs sanitized? Queries parameterized? |
| 4   | Insecure Design           | Threat modeling done?                    |
| 5   | Security Misconfiguration | Headers set? Defaults changed?           |
| 6   | Vulnerable Components     | `npm audit` clean?                       |
| 7   | Auth Failures             | Rate limiting? Strong passwords?         |
| 8   | Data Integrity            | Signatures verified?                     |
| 9   | Logging Failures          | Security events logged?                  |
| 10  | SSRF                      | External URLs validated?                 |
